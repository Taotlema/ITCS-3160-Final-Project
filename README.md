# ITCS-3160-Final-Project
 This project is a collaborative final assignment for the ITCS 3160: Database Design and Implementation course at UNC Charlotte.

## About the Project
The goal of the assignment was for us to create a relational database using SQL Queries. To do so our group used U.S. International Goods and Services trada data provided by the U.S. Census Bereau. Which we can leverage to create a database and queries that can provide insighs in trade dynamics the United States has with 10 countries from the European and Pacific Rim Regions.
